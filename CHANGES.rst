VectorGraphics2D 0.14 (UNRELEASED)
==================================
- Remove CMYK support from EPS generation `#79 <https://github.com/eseifert/vectorgraphics2d/pull/79>`_

VectorGraphics2D 0.13 (2017-08-08)
==================================

- Java 7 and Gradle 4 are now required to build VectorGraphics2D
- Restored compression support for PDF files
- All processors now have a standard constructor
- Added more JavaDoc documentation

VectorGraphics2D 0.12 (2017-07-28)
==================================

Be aware that due to restructuring this version does not support PDF Flate
compression. Turning on compression in ``PDFProcessor`` will lead to corrupt
output.

- **Major API change:** The classes ``EPSGraphics2D``, ``PDFGraphics2D`` and
  ``SVGGraphics2D`` have been removed. ``VectorGraphics2D`` is used instead in
  combination with a ``Processor`` instance to generate a ``Document`` object,
  which can then be written to an ``OutputStream``.
  See `README.rst <README.rst>`__ for code examples.
- The PDF code has seen some major restructuring as well to make it more robust
  and more standards compliant.
- SVG documents use of pixels for page size instead of millimeters by default.
- Better handling of font metrics (thanks to Anton Roslov, pull request #62)
- A bug that caused number to be formatted in computerized scientific notation,
  which is not supported in most formats (thanks to Jakub H., issue #63).
